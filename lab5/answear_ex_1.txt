The main problem with this algorithm is that it only works correctly if the samples cover every base position of the original DNA sequence sufficiently, ideally multiple times. 
Because the samples are taken randomly, some regions may be covered many times while others are missed entirely. 
Positions that are never sampled lead to gaps in reconstruction and under-sampled regions can result in incorrect results due to random majority. 
This uneven or incomplete coverage makes it impossible to accurately reconstruct the entire original sequence.
